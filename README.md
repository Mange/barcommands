# barcommands

Commands to run in i3blocks to get concise information about your system.

These commands will output colors from [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) and use icons from Font Awesome.

## Commands

### `bar-memory`

Prints memory usage as a simple percent with [Font Awesome's microchip icon](http://fontawesome.io/icon/microchip/) in front.

It will change to yellow and then to red as usage goes up. Click on it to temporarily see the numbers behind the percent.
